# Face Expressions:

CNN is used to detect the expressions.
One of the biggest myths about AI is that you need to have a large amount of data to 
obtain sufficient accuracy — and the rapid development of Big Data analytics seems to 
prove this intuition. It is true, that deep learning methods require model training on 
a huge number of labeled images. However, in image classification even a small collection 
of training images may produce a reasonable accuracy rate (90–100%) if using new machine 
learning techniques, that either make use of previously collected data to adjacent domains 
or modify the classification process completely, working on similarity of images.

    password = "Please enter your password of email"






















4. If gmail is blocking your email due to security purpose then you will get error.
	 to solve this error go to your google account security->Activate 2 step verification->
	 create app passwoed->user that app password in your code.
